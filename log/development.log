Leland is a loving little guy with so much to offer. He and his much fluffier brother, Allen, came to the Saving Grace program from a rural shelter. They had not had a lot of attention or care before arriving, but thanks to the extra TLC they received in a wonderful foster home, they are doing great. Leland is doing great with his crate training. He sleeps quietly all night and no messes in the morning. While he is still a pup at 8 months old, he is well on his way to being a well-mannered young adult. He should be about 18 pounds when fully grown. He is truly a mix of lots of things but we think he is a perfect little mix. He enjoys being with other dogs and would happily join an existing dog or pack at your home. He is affectionate and sweet. He will need a patient home at first to help him adjust to a new situation.", "avatar"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fa485b34df0 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/s1/0388bcd171xb6p2rd2lp4lp00000gp/T/RackMultipart20150609-25457-geok7o.jpg>, @original_filename="puppy1.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"dog[avatar]\"; filename=\"puppy1.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Dog", "id"=>"12"}
